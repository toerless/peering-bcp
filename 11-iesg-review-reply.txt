Dear Reviewer,

This is in response of your reviews of

Thank you so much for your thorough review. In response to the IESG
feedback, version -12 and -13 of the draft where posted which we hope 
will resolve the open issues.
make 2

Version -12 of the draft was just a conversion from docx generated txt to XML (previous generations
where not built from XML), this introduced formatting changes (line wraps etc.) that rfcdiff can not ignore
and that would have obfuscated actual content changes. 

Version -13 of the draft contains the text changes done in response to your
comments and discusses. The following RFC diff shows the content diffs
vs. -11 without any formatting introduced changes:

In summary:
   Beside the various smaller fixups from comments, the mayor rewritten/new blocks are:

   4.1.1 - bandwidth management (aka: congestion control section). 
           I didn't just want to put the magic CC sentence in but wanted to let
           readers understand what it means in the context of specifically
   6. Security considerations
      6.1.  DoS attacks (against state and bandwidth)	
      6.2.  Content security	
      6.3.  Peering encryption
      6.4.  Operational Aspects
            This is where the securing of log exchange is discussed.
   7. Privacy Considerations
      Got somewhat longer to explain because the specifics of multicast content and privacy
      are likely not that obious to non-multicast  experienced readers, and given how this
      is a BCP and i don't even think we did describe this anywhere else, it had to be
      explanatory.
   
   4.2.4.  Public Peering Routing Aspects
      text did mention non-private peerings, but i was afraid that readers would not
      understand the problematic implications, so i detailled them given how those
      peering L2 domains are still common for unicast.

Ben Campbell:

Thanks a lot for the thorough review!

> (This is related to Alissa's DISCUSS about logging of privacy-sensitive data. But since it's a little different, I'm entering my own DISCUSS.)
> 
>  In section 4.4 (operations) the bullet on problem notification states that AD2 will inform AD1 of, among other things, the locations of users. Is that intended to be geolocation, or network location? If the former, that's extremely sensitive information, and needs privacy guidelines.

Modified to say "Network location" (of affected EUs).

> Substantive Comments:
>

Yes, see feedback to their positions.

> 
> - There seem to be quite a few implied assumptions about business models. I will call out some specifically, but I'm sure I didn't catch them all. These assumptions should either be removed or made explicit.

I did not find other assumptions beyond the ones you list below. Pls let us know explicitly what others you think exist.

> - The lists of guidelines seem to mix guidelines with observations of fact. This makes it difficult to tell which parts are "best practices" (that is, recommendations) vs which parts simply state fact.
> 
> -2: Is the assumption that the source is a service provider and the consumer is an end-user relevant? This seems to perpetuate the (often false) assumption that end users only consume content, but never produce it. It would be better to state this in the form of whatever assumptions are implied by the idea of SPs and EUs.  For example, do you assume there is a one to many relationship between SPs and EUs?

Pls. check the revised first bullet (and sub-bullet) points of the introduction. It now says that there is one AD-1 but one or more AD-2. It also limits scope to EU just receiving content, but not sourcing it. It gives a suggestion how to let end-users source content but declares the detail out of scope.

To answer your points beyond what i changed in the text:

Yes, the assumption that this is a complete end-to-end story from someone (AD-1) taking responsibility  for sourcing the content to many end-users consuming the service is relevant because it allows us to constrain the scope/size of this document. If you think we should also have text for any of the current "out of scope" areas, i would be a lot happier if we could do this in BCPbis.

> -3.2: Why does this section not rate a figure? I think it would be helpful to show the GRE tunnel as distinct from the native multicast.

Done. Please check picture and modified text referring to it.

> -3.5, paragraph after Figure 4: The large number of tunnels implies some assumptions about the cardinality between SPs and EUs that should be stated explicitly. (It would help to show this in the figures.)

Done. Put into picture: N# EU/G -> N x AMT Tunnel.

Also updated both AMT pictures to show the fact that the AMT nodes are not necessarily the same as the physcial exchange point nodes.

> - 4.3.2: The idea that that AD1 has a need to identify users in AD2 seems to be based on some implied business model assumptions. Please state those explicitly. (Or if I missed where they are stated, please point out the text.)

Not really..  I added to 4.3.2:

    <t>The reason to specifically mention the need for AD-1 to initiate
    interactions with AD-2 (and use some account for that), as opposed
    to the opposite direction is based on the recommended workflow
    initiated by customers (see <xref target="section-4.4"/>): Customer
    contacts content source (part of AD-1), when AD sees the need to propagate 
    the issue, it will interact with AD-2.</t>

I am somewhat hesitating to bring long & gory explanations why we choose
this approach, because there are so many different reasons one could cite
and it cold become quite long:

-> Its the logical workflow with unicast content service.
-> Its the workflow also in CDN, even specifically in CDNI
-> Its logical that you start diagnostics from the application side
   and only once you figure out that the issue is NOT application, but
   network, you go down to network diagnostic. And you can start that
   usually only from the application sender side.
-> You want to make operations for all the AD-2 lightweight. The idea is NOT
   for all AD-2 to become broadcasters with a virtual headend. Instead
   they just need to be involved in the transport layer and beyond that
   only into the pieces they want to.

Let me know if you feel strongly that this reasoning needs to be written down.

> -4.3.3: This states that logging is necessary for delivery. Why is that? Again, this seems to make some implicit business model assumptions. This section also needs explicit privacy considerations.

I have rewritten the beginning of 4.3.3 into 4 paragraphs to hopefully make this clearer.

- I have also added a whole privacy consideration section (8.) that discusses
  privacy hopefully exhaustively enough.

Please re-check.

> -4.4: The choice of monitoring, etc, seems to be up to the network operators to decide. Why does this document need to "expect" that? It might be helpful to describe how monitoring specific information could be useful (perhaps for troubleshooting), but the document does not go into that. 

I have changed the first two paragraphs to hopefully set the context better:

    <t> Successful delivery of applications via multicast between pairs of
       interconnecting AD's can be improved through the ability to
       exchange appropriate logs for various workflows - troubleshooting,
       accounting/billing, traffic/content optimization, market research
       and so on. Except when the log includes information about the
       IP multicast behavior in AD-2, this is not specific to IP multicast
       solutions but equally desirable in Unicast-content delivery collaboration
       collaboration across AD-1/AD-2 (e.g.: for CDN services).</t>
    
    <t> The following type of logs are well understood examples known to help support operations
       in AD-1 when provided by AD-2. This could be done as part of AD-1/AD-2 contracts:</t>

Let us know please if you insist on examples. detailing operational workflows
can add quite a bit of text to the document.
 
> The statements about compensation should be out of scope for an IETF document.

Done. See my comment to the same point raised by Alissa if you like.

> -5: Can you define, or reference a definition for, "Looking-Glass style".

Ok, that paragraph didn't quite make sense to me either. I think my
co-authors where thinking about one specific implementation option, but
it really does not matter how its done. I for once did this in the past
just via radius controlled limited authentication profiles for TACACS accounts
into routers... yada yada -> removed looking-glass style mentioning, but
refined text to hightlt mtrace/traceroute more and discuss alternative
of providing this diag via EU.

> -6: Please include a discussion of threat models. When might one choose to encrypt or not encrypt? What risks exist if you don't encrypt?

Please re-read the security section. I did do a mayor overhaul to
hopefully better identify the security issues different from unicast
and to describe the attack vectors. Both for the encryption at the
peering point and other points.

> -- : "DRM and Application Accounting, Authorization and Authentication should be the responsibility of the multicast application source"
> Why? This seems to imply some business model assumptions.

No. It is only implication of the fact that this
document only considers network layer peering, but end-to-end
transport/app layer (to make it as close as possible to existing
unicast models where the same is done). See rewritten text of security section, should
make it much clearer now, i hope.

> Editorial Comments:

> - General: I find the heavy use of nested bullet lists hard to read. Much of the information in the lists would be better suited to paragraph form, especially when list entries span several sentences.  Likewise, the inconsistent use of full sentences vs fragments makes it hard to read. (Maybe this is just me)

I XML'ified the document which removed a lot of surpls indentation,
but introduced more vertial white space hopefully this helps. Looks nicer to me now ;-))

In or defense, the WG did ask for structured bullet
listed format of the document to create more consistency and easier
vetting of individual statements made. 

I hope you can live through this because i am fearful of
doing more verbal changes (mayority of readers/commenters didn't complain about formatting).

> -2: Please explain (s,g) before using, or even better spell it out. You do, in fact, explain it in 4.2.3, but it's used quite a bit before you get to there.

That is about the most fundamental IP multicast term and is typically
used intentionally as a first line of defense against reader not
familiar enoigh with IP multicast to understand the text. 

But since you asked so nicely, the first instance now reads:

(S,G)s (multicast traffic flows, 
        see <xref target="section-4.2.1"/> if you are unfamiliar with IP multicast).

> -3.2, third bullet: "Ability to support only partial IP multicast deployments..."

   <t>Ability to support partial and/or incremental IP multicast deployments in AD-
    1 and/or AD-2: Only the path(s) between AS/BR (AD-1) and BR/EU (AD-2) need to  
    be multicast enabled. The uBRs (and paths between BR and uBR) may not support IP multicast 
    or enabling it could be seen as operationally risky on that important nodes whereas dedicated
    BR nodes for IP multicast are more acceptable. BR can be located such that 
    only parts of the domain may need to support native IP multicast (e.g.: only the
    core in AD-1 but not access).</t>

Ok. We couldn't find a co-author willing to do a fundamental overhaul
of the text to better "activate"? the draft. Not being a native english
speaker myself, i always welcome help to improve on my english, but
i would prefer very explicit suggestions/proposed text, otherwise i may
just be replacing one bad english sentence with another one.

Ok, went through the whole document and tried to come up with creative alternatives to "/".

Check rewritten paragraph, pls.

Done.

Alissa Cooper:

Sure. Pls. re-read the first four paragraphs of the Log Management section, i tried to make
it clearer. Also the new section on privacy.

> (1) Why does this document contain the copyright disclaimer for pre-RFC5378 work?

It has been there since -00, and i can not think of any reason why it should be there,
so i removed it.

Will also send email to working group mailing list to re-check.

Pls. re-read the security section, i have tried to rewrite it with
a clearer description of these aspect. As someone like me who is
deep int the subject matter it is always easy to overlook explaining
what we may think are well understood fundamentals, so please keep
complaining until its understandable!

I tried to fix this text a bit more comprehensively:
- removed text from 3.1. The CC requirements apply to every subsection of 3 (3.x)
  and it duplicates partial text in 4.1, so a random mentioning in 3.1 was not
  helpfull.
- Moved CC text from 4.1 to dedicated section 4.1.1 and made it a lot more explanatory
  because in my past experience most readers do not really understand our cryptic
  rules alone ("CC principles across non-controlled network paths"). Also added
  reference to the fresh BCP145.

Please re-read new section and let me know what you think.

Yes, i thought about this and came up with the following explanation:
   
   <t>Note that except for implied multicast specific elements,
   the options listed here are not unique or novel for IP multicast, but
   they are more important for services novel to the operators than for

Removed - for the time being. I was told that having a wrap up in documents is
always a good way to reflect on the document, but i agree the existing text
is more distracting than helpful.

I thought about this a lot, and i hope the fixed up text in various sections is now better.

In the end i tried to focus the description on the model that makes this closest to
unicast, eg.: where the end-to-end application is in control and just gets network
transport information from the other parties involved, eg.: AD-2 -> AD-1. So all the
information collected via logs etc. to the extend that it is per-user is really only about the transport service
and not the payload. Something which in unicast the content source would already have.

The only privacy sensitive information directly related to multicast is really "who is watching
what content" and i created a privacy consideration section for that aspect, pls. review.

[ Side note:

  Personally i think there is a real bad amount of personal info collected by
  end-to-end applications, especially what i've seen in the past in content delivery for
  monetization strategies such as targeted advertisements and the like, but seemingly there is no
  place in the IETF where this is discussed (would have to be somehwere in ART).
  IETF only seems to obsess about protecting the sensitive information against third parties
  which is good but totally not sufficient.

  I did add the last paragraph in the privacy section to hint at this and that
  multicast could help to solve this, but alas i fear that there is no interest
  in the paycheck generating part of the IETF community to explore those options
  because that invasion on privacy is at the core of the business model of most application
  service providers.  *sigh*

Right.

Alas, I am not aware of any established security standards to protect equivalent operational data
exchanged for unicast between SPs. I fear i would not like the answers if i asked what
is actually done. That makes it somewhat hard to be very specific. besides, with the
advent of SDN and the slow sunset of lots of insecure NNI protocols (IPfix anybody),
the option are endless.

I've tried to describe what i hope are sufficient recommendations into te first
paragraphs of section 7.4, "operational aspects" of security considerations. Please check it out.

Fixed this type, but will definitely do another spell checker after getting

Lower cased all MUST/SHOULD/MAY (where only few).

I think the use of the word "recommend" is in general ok. In the case
above, this was immediately preceeding the now fixed text where
i am using "assume". So i hope this solves the point you raised.

It's also worth mentioning that I'm guessing that "section 3" is "this section" in that text, and I'm pretty sure "this section" isn't "section 2", which is actually where the sentence appears, but it might be easier for the reader to say "will also be described in section 3".

I removed that paragraph because this applies to all scenarios anyhow,
and because BCP38 is really only a necessary ad-on consideration for
unicast. Instead section 7.1 second paragraph now explains how RPF
forwarding is part of PIM-SM/SSM and therefore provides equivalent
protection to BCP38.

;-) I actually didn't write that point and i do not agree that it is
much of a problem in the deployment scenario, but it was a consensus
between authors to have it. IMHO the likelyhood that in this setup the
GRE tunnel is at times not used at all is fairly low. You wouldn't bother
about setting up this tunnel in the first place if it wasn't expected
to be used regularily. And its not per-user, so little state wasted even
if it is unused.

No, not really. We discussed DNS but didn't make progress with that
draft yet. I think that short term deployments can quickly solve
those problems with simple SDN style automation though and then
standardize.

Do the protocols in question adequately ensure that the addresses in question wish to receive the data. Specifically, the issue I am concerned with is whether I can cause you to get a large video stream. I'm filing this as a Comment rather than a Discuss because it doesn't seem like an issue for this BCP but rather for the protocols it documents.

In SSM multicast, a receiver will not receive any unwanted traffic
from any source, but only traffic from those sources that it wants to receive
traffic from. Receiver issues a so-called (S,G) membership indicating it wants
from source S the traffic for group G (think of G as the equivalent of a TCP port).

Of course, all the goodness of SSM multicast is easily invalidated by the
application on the receiver device. You know, browsers that start receiving
streaming videos into some windows on the bottom of your desktop you've long
 forgotten because some content owner tries to pushes more Ads to you...

(sorry, couldn't resist ;-)

> Please define S,G at first use.

  <t>A service provider controls one or more application sources in
        AD-1 which will send multicast IP packets for one or more
        (S,G)s (multicast traffic flows,
        see <xref target="section-4.2.1"/> if you are unfamiliar with IP multicast).

Those sentences where removed due to comments by other reviewers.

Your is is actually better guidance than the simple "should be out of scope" i saw
in other reviewers comments: i like the: not enough actionable information to pass bar for BCP.

We did have i think 10 years ago an attempt to standardize
multicast billing/accounting information exchange between SPs, alas those drafts never finished
because they where somewhat ill-build (on the wrong protocols). I think thats
why we as authors wanted to remind the community, but a reminder alone is not
sufficient for a BCP.

Thanks. Added.

Interesting. This is my first BCP co-authoring, so its not clear to me
how references have to inherit state based on the way they are referred to in
a BCP (as opposed to being use in conjunction with a MUST/SHOULD in a standards
track RFC where i do understand this). Any pointer ?

I don't think that Dave Thaler is interested to make MDH finally an RFC after 17 years
of hiatus, although now that he's not IAB maybe he has more time ;-) And the
draft would definitely deserve it.

In any case, MDH-04 is informative reference and i weakened the sentence
referring to it to avoid IETF process mess followup:

<t>It is recommended that multicast diagnostics will be performed
   leveraging established operational practices such as documented in <xref target="MDH-04"/>. </t>

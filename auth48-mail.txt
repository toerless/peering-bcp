Instructions for Completing AUTH48 in XML

This is your last chance to make changes to your RFC-to-be: 
draft-ietf-mboned-interdomain-peering-bcp-14.txt.
Once the document is published as an RFC, we will not make changes.  
Please follow the instructions below to complete the AUTH48 process.
(For frequently asked questions, please see 
https://www.rfc-editor.org/faq/#auth48.)

1) Review the edited document completely.  The files are available here:

   https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/rfc8313.txt
   https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/rfc8313-diff.html

   We recommend reviewing the entire document, not just the diff file.
   FYI, http://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff provides tools to make various
   kinds of diff files.

   The placement of page breaks will be handled during the final stages of
   publication (typically post-xml2rfc processing).

2) Review and resolve (as necessary) any questions raised by the RFC
   Editor.  The questions (if any) have been included in the XML file as
   comments marked <!-- [rfced] ... --> and will be sent in a subsequent email.

   Retrieve the edited XML file here:

      https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/rfc8313.xml

   (Note that you may need to view the page source to save the file.)

3) Send us your changes or respond with your approval for publication.  
   Please use 'REPLY ALL' so that rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org and the parties
   CC'ed on this message receive your response. Note that your document will
   not move forward until we have received approvals from each of the
   authors listed on the front page.

   Note that, because you are listed in the document header, you are 
   responsible for reviewing and approving the RFC-to-be for publication.
   As part of that, you are also responsible for engaging other parties 
   (e.g., Contributors or Working Group) as necessary before providing 
   your approval.

   If sending changes, please do one of the following:

   a. Update the provided XML file, then email us the revised XML file.  
      You may use any filename for the revised file; we will rename it 
      before posting it.

   --OR--

   b. Provide us with an explicit list of changes in this format.

      Section # (or indicate Global)
   
      OLD:
      old text
   
      NEW:
      new text

   Be sure to pay particular attention to these areas of the document:
   - IANA Considerations updates (if applicable)
   - Contact information
   - Copyright notice and legends (see item 5 for more details)

4) Review changes submitted by your coauthors (if any).  We assume that
   you will speak up if you do not agree with the proposed changes.
   That is, your silence is your assent to changes submitted by your
   coauthors. Note that any changes that are beyond editorial will be
   sent to the relevant body for approval.

5) Review the copyright notice and legends as defined in RFC 5378 and the
   Trust Legal Provisions (TLP -- https://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/).

   If your document was approved for publication with a pre-RFC-5378
   copyright notice, we have applied the text from section 6.c.iii of the
   TLP.  Please consider whether this text is required (note that the
   6.c.iii text is not applicable to Alternate Stream RFCs).  See item
   4.5 of the "Copyright FAQ" at https://trustee.ietf.org/faq.html for
   guidance on whether this text applies to your document.

6) Please reply, as the document will not be published until we receive
   approvals from each author.  The details of the AUTH48 status of your
   document are here:

Thank you for your cooperation,

RFC Editor

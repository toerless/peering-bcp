> Question 3: Section 1:  We could not find text in Section 2 that relates to this sentence.  Please confirm that "Section 2" is correct here.

I think this was purely textual. On one side we said "multicast stream", on the other "(S,G).
I modified the response by including (S,G) into the place where we only said "multicast stream" so
the two text places match up.

> Question 4: Section 3.1:  BCP 145 (RFC 8085) does not mention "rate adaption," and it appears that the RFCs cited in RFC 8085 don't mention it either.  Please confirm that this citation is correct and will be clear to readers who refer to it. Toerless, Greg. Can you please confirm this citation???

I have updated the response below accordingly.

> Question 16: Section 4.2.4:  To what does "above example" refer in this sentence?  Please clarify.

Your answer was correct, Figure 6.

> Question 27: Section 6.2:  Does "a separate network forwarding authentication/authorization scheme" mean "a separate traffic-forwarding authentication/authorization scheme," 
> "a separate authentication/authorization scheme for forwarding network traffic," or something else?  Please clarify.

Your answer was correct. traffic-forwarding authorization in network as opposed to authorization to get decryption key at application layer.

> Thank you
> Percy S. Tarapore

So, thanks a lot for all your work.

I did go through the reply, formatted it and did a few formal changes:

3) Suggested text improvement (as discussed above).

4) fixed reply

9) (->MP-BGP)

format/various) changed reply to be consistent with the XML format (eg: "Use Case 3.2" to "Use Case Section 3.2")

15) Ads -> ADs

If you're fine with the below suggested modified reply mail, pls. reply with it to the original mail thread.

> 1) Section 1:  We had trouble following this sentence, because we do not see AD-1 referred to as the multicast source in any other text in this document.  Please clarify "AD-1 that this document refers to as the multicast source."
>
> Original:
> 
> To support that additional service, it is  recommended to use some method (outside the scope of this
> 
> document) by which the content from EUs is transmitted to the  application in AD-1 that this document refers to as the  multicast source and let it send out the traffic as IP  multicast.

Analysis:
   This concern is very narrowly looking at the term "multicast source" and the doc uses looser statements about AD-1 in various places, eg: "Administrative Domain 1 (AD-1) sources content to one or more End Users (EUs)" (content, not multicast), or "one or more application sources in AD-1 which will send multicast IP packets "... (content source sends the multicast, not "AD-1" sends it,...)

   In any case, this side sentence is redundant and best be removed.

Authors Change:
    Delete the phrase “that this document refers to as the multicast source” from the sentence as follows:

Result
    “This document does not detail the case where EUs are originating content.  To support that additional service, it is recommended to use some method (outside the scope of this document) by which the content from EUs is transmitted to the application in AD-1 and let it send out the traffic as IP multicast.”

Author’s Response:
   This change is correct. Please change the sentence as recommended

> 3) Section 1:  We could not find text in Section 2 that relates to this sentence.  Please confirm that "Section 2" is correct here.
> 
> Original:
> 
> o  As described in Section 2, the source IP address of the multicast stream in the originating AD (AD-1) is known.


Author’s Response:
   Section 2 is correct. The following statement in Section 2 confirms the source IP address:

  “The application client joins appropriate (S,G)s in order to receive the data necessary to provide the service to the EU.”. The phrase (S,G) refers to the Source ID and Group ID.

Change:
     Added reference to (S,G) to original sentence to easier match it to the sentence in question:

     As described in Section 2, the source IP address of the (so called (S,G)) multicast stream in the originating AD (AD-1) is known.


> 4) Section 3.1:  BCP 145 (RFC 8085) does not mention "rate adaption," and it appears that the RFCs cited in RFC 8085 don't mention it either.  Please confirm that this citation is correct and will be clear to readers who refer to it.
> 
> Original:
> 
> If this is not the case, then the multicast  traffic must support rate-adaption (see [BCP145]).

Comment:

If you read BCP145 you will see terms such as "adapt the sending rate", but the whole doc always tries
to use the term "congestion control" because thats the goal. "rate adaptation" is the preferred mechanism.
The other one is to stop the traffic ;-)

Change to:

If this is not the case, then the multicast  traffic must support congestion control via any of the
mechanisms described in <xref target="BCP145"/>, section 4.1.

> 5) Section 3.2:  Should "can or should not be enabled" be "cannot be or should not be enabled," "can be enabled or should not be enabled," or something else?  Please clarify.
> 
> 
> Original ("choosen" and "physcially" have been corrected):
>  Normally, this approach is choosen if the uBR physcially connected to  the peering link can or should not be enabled for IP multicast.

Author’s Response: 
  The correct sentence should be as follows:

Normally, this approach is chosen if the uBR physically connected to  the peering link cannot or should not be enabled for IP multicast.

Author’s Response: This addition is correct.

>

Author’s Response:
    This refers to Use Case 3.1. Please add the following to the sentence:

"the fully native multicast Use Case (Section 3.1)"
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Author’s Response:
   Please change text to:

AMT Tunnel Connecting AMT Gateways and Relays

> 9) Section 4.1:  "MBGP" is not used anywhere in RFC 4760.

> "MBGP" can stand for "Multicast BGP" (per RFC 5760) or "Multiprotocol BGP" (per RFC 6831).  Please let us know how we should cite "MBGP" here (and expand it in the legend for Figure 1) for ease of the reader.

>Original:

>o  Peering Point Protocol Support - Multicast protocols that will be used for multicast delivery will need to be supported at these points.  Examples of protocols include eBGP [RFC4760] and MBGP [RFC4760].

Author’s Response (toerless):
 Yes, MBGP is a really bad term because it's confused between the two meanings that you see those example RFCs
 (multicast or multiprotocol).  Best to avoid the term.

Change:
 Examples of protocols include eBGP (exterior BGP peering) via MP-BGP (MultiProtocol BGP) SAFI-2 (RFC4760).
 Also: Change any other occurance of MBGP to MP-BGP. (in pictures)

Author’s Response: This change is correct

Author’s Response: Please delete the entire bullet.

Author’s Response: Change to:

Native multicast functionality is assumed to be available across many  ISP backbones, peering points, and access networks.


> 19) Section 4.3.2:  To what does "propagate the issue" refer in this sentence?  Does it mean "communicate the problem," "convey the customer's request," or something else?  Please clarify.
> 
> Original:
> 
> The reason to specifically mention the need for AD-1 to initiate  interactions with AD-2 (and use some account for that), as opposed to  the opposite direction is based on the recommended workflow initiated  by customers (see Section 4.4): The customer contacts content source  (part of AD-1), when AD-1 sees the need to propagate the issue, it  will interact with AD-2 using the aforementioned guidelines.


Author’s Response: Please change the sentence to:

The customer contacts the content source which is part of AD-1. Consequently, if AD-1 sees the need to escalate the issue to AD-2, it  will interact with AD-2 using the aforementioned guidelines.


> 20) Section 4.3.3:  It appears that some words are missing from this sentence (e.g., possibly a citation for another section instead of "in before" and "the content source and on its behalf AD-1").

> The basic model as explained in before is that the content source and  on its behalf AD-1 take over primary responsibility for customer  experience and the AD-2's support this.

Author’s Response: Change the sentence to:

Specifically, AD-1 takes over primary responsibility for customer experience on behalf of the content source with support from AD-2 as needed.

For example, for the AMT Use Cases (Use Cases Section 3.3, Section 3.4, and Section 3.5), one or more AMT Relays may be experiencing difficulties.

Author’s Response: We accept the suggested change.

Author’s Response: The statement is correct. Per Figure 3, the AMT Tunnel extends from the AMT Relay in AD-1 all the way to the EU/G. Ths the AMT Relay in AD-1 is indeed the last replication point. No change is necessary.

This would establish the same authenticated EU only copy that is used in unicast.

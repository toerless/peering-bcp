I have attached a fixed up XML file with the changes as described below.

Thanks. See list below. Not sure if keywords that are multiple words
(eg: multicast security) are permitted. Likewise for variations that
users likely may look for even if "incorrect" (MBGP, M-BGP).
Just remove what you do not like.

Good change. thank you.

Good changes. thank you.

The best wording would IMHO be:

    also, either AR = uBR (AD-1) or uBR = AG (AD-2)";

> (We ask this because we see "otherwise AR=uBR (AD-1) or ubr=AGAR1
> (AD-2)" in Figure 5 (i.e., "or" as opposed to "and").)

Which should be 

    also, either AR=uBR (AD-1) or ubr=AGAR1 (AD-2)

The idea is that only one of the uBR could include the multicast 
function (AR/AG/AGAR1). If both uBR can do the multicast functions,
then the cases deteriorate to use case 3.1.

(Geeks would of course write xor instead of either/or ;-)

Please use the word adaptation, that seems to be the preferred form:

http://grammarist.com/usage/adaption-adaptation/

(I guess i was always preferring adaption because its the same word in German.)

No action on author side i think (otherwise approved).

Sending is an activity performed by a source, so "are permitted _to_be_ sent"
sounds wrong to me. "are permitted to send" would IMHO be correct. Also
remove the parenthesis around the last part, that is the key piece of
the sentence, the rest is just the necessary context.

> Thank you.

Thank you so much. Lots of great editorial improvements of the doc through
your work, just read through it again.

Of course somewhat frustrating to see how bad the english of
the document was, but i fancy myself in two excuses: a) i am not a native
english speaker, b) there are hopefully a lot better writers that only
manage to produce readable books beause of good editors ;-)

Only outstanding change from my side is my previously raised ask for
a second email address for me in the doc.

Cheers
